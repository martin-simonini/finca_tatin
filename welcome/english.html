			   Hotel Finca Tatin is a very special place, located between the town of Fronteras (Rio Dulce), and Livingston, accessible only by boat,
			   the perfect place to get away from it all!
			</p>

			<p>
				The Rio Dulce area is one of the best places in Guatemala to experience bio-diversity, with its lush and pristine forest and rivers, and the abundance of wildlife.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finca Tatin is a rustic eco-lodge that focuses on preserving its beautiful natural surroundings, while helping the indigenous communities living in the area and
				offering a chance to the city dwellers to get their share of wilderness.
			</p>

			<p>
				 While situated in a quite remote location, there still is no shortage on things to do and see. The bungalows are either located on riverside or in the jungle.
				 At the hotel you can jump in the river from our rope swing, before laying on our floating sunbed to work on your tan, without having to worry about nasty aquatic
				 animals. We also offer a variety of activities to partake in: walk to Ak&rsquo;Tenamit, the biggest school in the area, explore the tiger cave and take a dip in its
				 natural pools, or pay a visit to a typical Mayan village.
			</p>

			<p>
			  We also have canoes and kayaks for our guests to use, and the river is dotted with beautiful spots which make for a nice day of adventuring.
			  You can paddle your way through the canyon to Livingston, a Caribbean beach town, while enjoying the amazing scenery along the two hour trip;
			  gliding past thatch-roofed houses and enormous cliffs covered in trees, themselves home to birds of all kinds. On a sunny day you will easily spot bright orange
			  iguanas as they charge their batteries in the tree tops. There will be no need to paddle back against the current as we will pick you up in Livingston and take you
			  back to the hotel with one of our boats. We also offer a hike to Livingston, in which you will spend three to four hours walking through the forest before reaching
			  Livingston.
     		  </p>

			<p>
				We have many others kayaks and tours suggestions; night hikes and boat tours, full moon hikes, guided walk in the forest and on the river, and horseback tours.
				We recommend a dip in the thermal springs, or spend the day in the mandate reservoir, trying to spot one of those gentle aquatic mammals and other wild animals
				that live there. Or going to Belize for a morning of snorkeling? If R&R is more your style, Finca Tatin has wide assortment of games, or grab a book and relax in
				one of our many hammocks.
			</p>

			<p>As many hotels in Guatemala, we offer a family style dinner, where all the guest eat together and share stories around the table,  nice way to meet fellow travelers
			and make new friends. The meals are delicious and always made with fresh local ingredients. Dinners consist of a vegetable soup, handmade flour tortillas,
			and chimichurri, a parsley, garlic and olive oil dip cherished by everyone. Then comes a main dish and a variety of accompanying dishes. We also have a vegetarian
			option, and we cater to anyone who needs special meals.</p>

			<p>Due to our remoteness, electricity in the hotel is run on a generator we turn on between the hours of 6pm (18:00) and 10pm (22:00). During these time you have access
			to the free Wi-Fi, to check your mails or Facebook and keep up with the outside hassles. Or you can watch a movie in the tv room. But when the generator goes off, that&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;re on vacations!</p>

			<p>Looking for a simple, laid-back place, excellent food, good company and nice spots to explore? Then Finca Tatin is your destination! </p>
